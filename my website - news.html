	<p class="font1" style="text-align: center;">OPERATIONS CHANGES:
Going forward we are addressing the balance issues with the Operations game mode. It’s clear that attackers need a boost. To increase the effectiveness of the attacking team, we are increasing the overall tickets for both Operations & Grand Operations. In addition, we are also making it somewhat easier to capture sectors as an attacker by reducing the amount of time it takes to capture a flags in Operations & Grand Operations. We’ve also increased the minimum tickets regained in grand operations to from 30 to 50, as well as increased the amount of tickets regained from killing retreating defenders. This will give more of a fighting chance to capture the next sector after previously capturing a sector while having very few tickets left.<br />

-- 64 player
Increase attacker maximum tickets from 150 to 250
Increased the amount of tickets regained from killing retreating defenders after capturing a sector from 2 to 3.
Increased the amount of minimum ticket regained when capturing a sector in 64p Operations from 30 to 50.
Slightly reduced the time it takes to capture flags.<br />

-- 40 player
Increase attacker maximum tickets to 200 from 150
Increased the amount of tickets regained from killing retreating defenders after capturing a sector from 2 to 3.
Slightly reduced the time it takes to capture flags.</p>
